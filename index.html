    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together
      until combined. Set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer
      fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese together
      for 2 minutes on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the
      granulated sugar and beat on medium high speed until fluffy and light in
      color. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and almond extract on high speed. Scrape
      down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into
      the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be thick. Cover
      dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour and
      up to 3 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the
      cookie dough chilled longer than 3-4 hours, let it sit at room temperature
      for about 20 minutes. This makes the cookie dough easier to scoop and
      roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large
      baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
      Pour the 1/2 cup of granulated sugar into a bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>Scoop and roll balls of dough, about 1.5
      Tablespoons of dough each. Roll each ball into granulated sugar then place
      on the baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Using the back of measuring cup
      or drinking glass, gently press down on each
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>Bake the cookies for 13-15 minutes, or until very
      lightly browned on the edges. My oven has hot spots and yours may too- so
      be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. The baked cookies will
      look extremely soft in the centers when you remove them from the oven.
      Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to cooling rack
      to cool completely before frosting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong><em> Make the frosting:</em> In a medium bowl
      using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat
      the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until creamy and
      no lumps remain, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla
      extract. Beat on low speed for 20 seconds then increase to high speed
      until everything is completely combined and the frosting is creamy. Taste.
      Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Spread on each cooled
      cookie, then decorate with sprinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for
      up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

              <li>3/4 cup (62g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>

                1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch
      cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment
      paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong><em>Make the cake:</em> Whisk the flour, cocoa
      powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if
      using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand
      mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil,
      eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the
      buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry
      ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed
      until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26
      minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
      Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a
      toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they’re
      completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa
      powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t
      hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate
      cake. It’s normal!)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire
      rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>Make the buttercream: With a handheld or stand
      mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed
      until creamy—about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3
      Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for
      30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not
      over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if
      frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too
      thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on
      top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to
      create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or
      crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or
      serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and
      spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an
      icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate
      chips, if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60
      minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve
      the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving.
      Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the
      refrigerator for 5 days. I like using a cake carrier for storing and
      transporting.

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong>Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder
      together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add
      it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or
      your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. See
      video above for a closer look at the texture. Place in the refrigerator or
      freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong>Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla
      extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the
      add-ins, then mix together until everything appears moistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong><em>To make triangle scones:</em> Pour onto the
      counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can.
      Dough will be sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it
      seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch
      disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges. For
      smaller scones, press dough into two 5-inch discs and cut each into 8
      wedges. To make 10-12 drop scones: Keep mixing dough in the bowl until it
      comes together. Drop scones, about 1/4 cup of dough each, 3 inches apart
      on a lined baking sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong>Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for
      extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after
      refrigerating in the next step.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong>Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if
      your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong>Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or
      silicone baking mat(s). If making mini or drop scones, use 2 baking
      sheets. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the
      prepared baking sheet(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong>Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown
      around the edges and lightly browned on top. Larger scones take closer to
      25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong>Leftover scones keep well at room temperature for
      2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 days.
